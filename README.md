## What is GitHub?

GitHub has convinced Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) developers that GitHub is the best (and even the only) place for FOSS development. However, as a proprietary, trade-secret tool, GitHub itself is the very opposite of FOSS. By contrast, Git was designed specifically to replace a proprietary tool (BitKeeper), and to make FOSS development distributed â€” using FOSS tools and without a centralized site. GitHub has warped Git â€” creating add-on features that turn a distributed, egalitarian, and FOSS system into a centralized, proprietary site.
